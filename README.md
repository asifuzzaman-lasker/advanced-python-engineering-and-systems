# Advanced Python Engineering and Systems

A structured deep-dive into Python internals, concurrency, performance engineering, and production-grade system design.

This repository is not a beginner tutorial.
It is an engineering-focused exploration of Python as a systems language — from execution model and memory management to scalable backend architecture.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The objective of this repository is to:

- Develop deep understanding of Python internals and execution model
- Analyze concurrency models (threading, multiprocessing, asyncio)
- Benchmark real-world performance trade-offs
- Build production-grade backend and system architectures
- Document edge cases and interview-critical behaviors
- Create reproducible experiments and engineering references

This repository follows a layered progression:

Language Core → Data Model → Internals → Concurrency → Performance → Production Systems → System Design
